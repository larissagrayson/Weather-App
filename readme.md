**Weather App**

**AUTHOR:**  Larissa Grayson

**DESCRIPTION:** The inspiration for this assignment came from *The Odin Project: JavaScript Web Development* [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

**OBJECTIVE:** The purpose of this project was to build a simple weather app, where a user can input a location and is presented with the current weather and a 5-day forecast.  This app is built using two different APIs.  The app first takes the location input from the form and calls an API to retrieve the geolocation (longitude and latitude) of the first match it finds.  The app then calls a second API with the given latitude and longitude and desired temperature unit (celsius or fahrenheit) to retrieve the weather forecast at that location. 

The app will then update the browser to display the weather data at that location - current temperature, high and low temperatures for the day, the sunrise and sunset in local time, as well as the current and 5 day forecast.  It will also update the background image to match the weather.

It is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  The layout is achieved using both CSS Grid and Flexbox.

**SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:**
 * 3rd Party APIs 
 * Async/Await/Promises
 * Date object - converting from UTC to user's date/time and then converting that to the local time at the location
 * Document Object Model (DOM)
 * Event Listeners
 * CSS Grid
 * CSS Flexbox
 * CSS Variables
 * Forms
 * Loaders

 The working version of this app can be found [here] (#)
